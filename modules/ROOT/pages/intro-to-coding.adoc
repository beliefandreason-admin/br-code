[quote, ComputerScience.org, https://www.computerscience.org/resources/what-is-coding-used-for ]
Computer programming languages, developed through a series of numerical or alphabetic codes, instruct machines to complete specific actions. 
Computer coding functions much like a manual.
*Coding* tells a machine what actions to perform and how to complete tasks. 
**Programming languages** provide the rules for building websites, apps, and other computer-based technologies. 
Each programming language helps humans accurately communicate with machines.
